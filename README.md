Scoop [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jgckhkhe5rdd6586/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rivy/scoop/branch/master)
=====

Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows.

#### Requirements

* PowerShell 3+
* PowerShell script execution policy must configured as either `unrestricted` or `bypass` for your user account

##### PowerShell Execution Policy

Please note that, for operation, `scoop` requires a liberal PowerShell execution policy (in the same manner as [`chocolatey`](https://chocolatey.org)). So, during installation, if the PowerShell execution policy for the current user is more restrictive than `unrestricted` (i.e., `restricted`, `allsigned`, or `remotesigned`), it will be changed to `unrestricted` and saved into the registry as the user's default policy.

#### Installation

To install, paste either of the following set of command strings at the respective shell prompt.

##### CMD Shell &middot; `C:\>`

    powershell -command "'https://raw.github.com/rivy/scoop/master/bin/install.ps1' |%{&$([ScriptBlock]::create((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring($_))) -origin $_}"
    set PATH=%PATH%;%LOCALAPPDATA%\scoop\shims

##### PowerShell &middot; `PS C:\>`

    'https://raw.github.com/rivy/scoop/master/bin/install.ps1' |%{&$([ScriptBlock]::create((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring($_))) -origin $_}

Once installed, run `scoop help` for instructions.

What does Scoop do?
-------------------

Scoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It tries to eliminate things like:
* Permission popup windows
* GUI wizard-style installers
* Path pollution from installing lots of programs
* Unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs
* The need to find and install dependencies
* The need to perform extra setup steps to get a working program

Scoop is very scriptable, so you can run repeatable setups to get your environment just the way you like, e.g.:

```powershell
scoop install sudo
sudo scoop install 7zip git openssh --global
scoop install curl grep sed less tail touch
scoop install python ruby go perl
```

If you've built software that you'd like others to use, Scoop is an alternative to building an installer (e.g. MSI or InnoSetup)â€”you just need to zip your program and provide a JSON manifest that describes how to install it.

What sort of apps can Scoop install?
------------------------------------

The apps that install best with Scoop are commonly called "portable" apps: i.e. compressed program files that run stand-alone when extracted and don't have side-effects like changing the registry or putting files outside the program directory.

Since installers are common, Scoop supports them too (and their uninstallers).

Scoop is also great at handling single-file programs and Powershell scripts. These don't even need to be compressed. See the [runat](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/blob/master/bucket/runat.json) package for an example: it's really just a GitHub gist.
